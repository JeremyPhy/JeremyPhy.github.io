Task-time
- my way of tracking things to do and time to do them

    store tasks and durations
        -task class that stores name and time required
        -stores tasks in array/or a manager
    times
        -end time stored, current time can be acquired both used to calculate remaining time
        -sums tasks times and calculates delta between required and remaining time
    interfacing
        -display data from json file?
        -clear json data
        -add/remove element from list
        -set end time
