I've made a personalized website to familiarize myself with front-end development. So far I've used HTML and CSS for website infrastructure and page styling. 

By reading it you can get to know me better, check out the projects I've done and see what inspires me.

Much like I am, this site is in a continual state of change, always for the better.
