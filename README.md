I've made a personalized website to familiarize myself with front-end development. So far I've used HTML and CSS along with Bootstrap 4 for website infrastructure and page styling. 

By reading it you can check out projects I've worked on, learn about my previous work experience and get to know me better.

Much like I am, this site is in a continual state of change, always for the better.
